```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#> ")
```

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(vctrs)

df <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = letters[1:10], stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dfs <- map(1:100, ~ df)
```

Currently, `vec_rbind()` is _much_ slower than the alternatives:

```{r}
bench::mark(
  do.call(rbind, dfs),
  vec_rbind(!!!dfs),
  dplyr::bind_rows(dfs)
)
```

I've removed the biggest bottlenecks coercing data frames to lists with `vec_data()`, operating on them, and then restoring with `vec_restore()`. This avoids the expensive data frame methods. I think further improvement (to get on par with base/dplyr) will require a systematic rewrite in C.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
profvis::profvis(vec_rbind(!!!dfs))
```
