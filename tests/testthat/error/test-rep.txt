`vec_rep()` validates `times`
=============================

> vec_rep(1, "x")
Error: Lossy cast from `times` <character> to <integer>.
* Locations: 1

> vec_rep(1, c(1, 2))
Error: `times` must be a single number.

> vec_rep(1, -1)
Error: `times` must be a positive number.

> vec_rep(1, NA_integer_)
Error: `times` can't be missing.


`vec_rep_each()` validates `times`
==================================

> vec_rep_each(1, "x")
Error: Lossy cast from `times` <character> to <integer>.
* Locations: 1

> vec_rep_each(1, -1)
Error: `times` must be a vector of positive numbers. Location 1 is negative.

> vec_rep_each(c(1, 2), c(1, -1))
Error: `times` must be a vector of positive numbers. Location 2 is negative.

> vec_rep_each(1, NA_integer_)
Error: `times` can't be missing. Location 1 is missing.

> vec_rep_each(c(1, 2), c(1, NA_integer_))
Error: `times` can't be missing. Location 2 is missing.
