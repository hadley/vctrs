vec_as_subscript() forbids subscript types
==========================================

> vec_as_subscript(1L, indicator = "error", location = "error")
Error: Must subset with a proper subscript vector.
x `i` has the wrong type `integer`.
i These indices must be names.

> vec_as_subscript("foo", indicator = "error", name = "error")
Error: Must subset with a proper subscript vector.
x `i` has the wrong type `character`.
i These indices must be locations.

> vec_as_subscript(TRUE, indicator = "error")
Error: Must subset with a proper subscript vector.
x `i` has the wrong type `logical`.
i These indices must be locations or names.

> vec_as_subscript("foo", name = "error")
Error: Must subset with a proper subscript vector.
x `i` has the wrong type `character`.
i These indices must be indicators or locations.

> vec_as_subscript(NULL, location = "error")
Error: Must subset with a proper subscript vector.
x `i` has the wrong type `NULL`.
i These indices must be indicators or names.

> vec_as_subscript(quote(foo), name = "error")
Error: Must subset with a proper subscript vector.
x `i` has the wrong type `symbol`.
i These indices must be indicators or locations.


vec_as_subscript2() forbids subscript types
===========================================

> vec_as_subscript2(1L, location = "error", indicator = "error")
Error: Must extract with a single subscript.
x `i` has the wrong type `integer`.
i This subscript must be a name.

> vec_as_subscript2("foo", name = "error", indicator = "error")
Error: Must extract with a single subscript.
x `i` has the wrong type `character`.
i This subscript must be a location.

> vec_as_subscript2(TRUE, indicator = "error")
Error: Must extract with a single subscript.
x `i` has the wrong type `logical`.
i This subscript must be a location or a name.
