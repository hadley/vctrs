\arguments{
\item{result}{The result of a potentially lossy cast.}

\item{x}{Vectors}

\item{to}{Type to cast to.}

\item{lossy}{A logical vector indicating which elements of \code{result}
were lossy.

Can also be a single \code{TRUE}, but note that \code{locations} picks up
locations from this vector by default. In this case, supply your
own location vector, possibly empty.}

\item{locations}{An optional integer vector giving the
locations where \code{x} lost information.}

\item{...}{Only use these fields when creating a subclass.}

\item{loss_type}{The kind of lossy cast to be mentioned in error
messages. Can be loss of precision (for instance from double to
integer) or loss of generality (from character to factor).}

\item{x_arg}{Argument names for \code{x} and \code{to}. These are used
in error messages to inform the user about the locations of
incompatible types (see \code{\link[=stop_incompatible_type]{stop_incompatible_type()}}).}

\item{to_arg}{Argument names for \code{x} and \code{to}. These are used
in error messages to inform the user about the locations of
incompatible types (see \code{\link[=stop_incompatible_type]{stop_incompatible_type()}}).}

\item{details}{Any additional human readable details.}

\item{message}{An overriding message for the error. \code{details} and
\code{message} are mutually exclusive, supplying both is an error.}

\item{class}{Only use these fields when creating a subclass.}

\item{.deprecation}{If \code{TRUE}, the error is downgraded to a
deprecation warning. This is useful for transitioning your class
to a stricter conversion scheme. The warning advises your users
to wrap their code with \code{allow_lossy_cast()}.}

\description{
\Sexpr[results=rd, stage=render]{vctrs:::lifecycle("experimental")}

By default, lossy casts are an error. Use \code{allow_lossy_cast()} to
silence these errors and continue with the partial results. In this
case the lost values are typically set to \code{NA} or to a lower value
resolution, depending on the type of cast.

Lossy cast errors are thrown by \code{maybe_lossy_cast()}. Unlike
functions prefixed with \code{stop_}, \code{maybe_lossy_cast()} usually
returns a result. If a lossy cast is detected, it throws an error,
unless it's been wrapped in \code{allow_lossy_cast()}. In that case, it
returns the result silently.
