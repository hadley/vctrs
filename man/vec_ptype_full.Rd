\section{S3 dispatch}{

The default method for \code{vec_ptype_full()} uses the first element of the
class vector. Override this method if your class has parameters that should
be prominently displayed.

The default method for \code{vec_ptype_abbr()} \code{\link[=abbreviate]{abbreviate()}}s \code{vec_ptype_full()}
to 8 characters. You should almost always override, aiming for 4-6
characters where possible.
