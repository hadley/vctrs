#' Order and sort vectors
#'
#' @description
#' `vec_order()` computes the order of `x`. For data frames, the order is
#' computed along the rows by computing the order of the first column and
#' using subsequent columns to break ties.
#'
#' `vec_sort()` sorts `x` by computing its order and using `vec_slice()` to
#' rearrange.
#'
#' @details
#' Character vectors are ordered in the C-locale. This is different from
#' `base::order()`, which respects `base::Sys.setlocale()`. Sorting in a
#' consistent locale can produce more reproducible results between different
#' sessions and platforms, however, the results of sorting in the C-locale
#' can be surprising. For example, capital letters sort before lower case
#' letters. Sorting `c("b", "C", "a")` with `vec_sort()` will return
#' `c("C", "a", "b")`, but with `base::order()` will return `c("a", "b", "C")`
#' unless `base::order(method = "radix")` is explicitly set, which also uses
#' the C-locale. While sorting with the C-locale can be useful for
#' algorithmic efficiency, in many real world uses it can be the cause of
#' data analysis mistakes. To balance these trade-offs, you can supply a
#' `chr_transform` to transform character vectors into an alternative
#' representation that orders in the C-locale in a less surprising way. For
#' example, providing [base::tolower()] as a transform will order the original
#' vector in a case-insensitive manner. Locale-aware ordering can be achieved
#' by providing `stringi::stri_sort_key()` as a transform, setting the
#' collation options as appropriate for your locale.
#'
#' Character vectors are always translated to UTF-8 before ordering, and before
#' any transform is applied by `chr_transform`.
#'
#' @param x A vector
#' @param direction Direction to sort in.
#'   - A single `"asc"` or `"desc"` for ascending or descending order
#'     respectively.
#'   - For data frames, a length `1` or `ncol(x)` character vector containing
#'     only `"asc"` or `"desc"`, specifying the direction for each column.
#' @param na_value Treatment of `NA` values. `NaN` values are treated as
#'   equivalent to `NA` values.
#'   - A single `"largest"` or `"smallest"` for treating `NA` values as the
#'     largest or smallest values respectively.
#'   - For data frames, a length `1` or `ncol(x)` character vector containing
#'     only `"largest"` or `"smallest"`, specifying how `NA`s should be treated
#'     in each column.
#' @param nan_distinct A single logical specifying whether or not `NaN` should
#'   be considered distinct from `NA` for double and complex vectors. If `TRUE`,
#'   `NaN` will always be ordered between `NA` and non-missing numbers.
#' @param chr_transform Transformation of character vectors for sorting in
#'   alternate locales.
#'   - If `NULL`, no transformation is done.
#'   - Otherwise, this must be a function of one argument. The function will be
#'     invoked with `x`, if it is a character vector, after it has been
#'     translated to UTF-8, and should return a character vector with the same
#'     length as `x`, also encoded as UTF-8.
#'   - For data frames, `chr_transform` will be applied to all character
#'     columns.
#'
#'   Common transformation functions include: `tolower()` for case-insensitive
#'   ordering and `stringi::str_sort_key()` for locale-aware ordering. See the
#'   Details section for more information.
